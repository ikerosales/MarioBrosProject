# Mario Bros Project in Python

### Description:

This project is a Python implementation inspired by the classic Mario Bros game. It uses advanced programming concepts such as algorithms, recursion, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to create a dynamic and interactive game environment.

The goal of the project is to simulate core gameplay mechanics, including character movement, level progression, and obstacle interaction, all while applying clean code practices and algorithmic efficiency.

## Key Features:

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is structured using OOP principles, with classes representing game entities such as Mario, enemies, and platforms. This modular design ensures easy scalability and maintenance.
  
- **Recursive Algorithms**: Recursion is used to handle complex in-game scenarios, such as solving level designs, calculating optimal movement paths, and managing game states.

### Game Mechanics and Features:

- **Player-controlled Mario** with jumping and running capabilities.
- **Enemies** that move with basic AI algorithms.
- **Interactive platforms and items** such as coins and power-ups.
- **Algorithms**: Efficient algorithms are implemented for tasks such as collision detection, pathfinding, and game logic, ensuring smooth performance even with complex level designs.

#### Additional Features:

1. **Invisible Block**: An invisible block has been introduced containing a green mushroom that adds an extra life.
2. **Start, Restart, and End Screens**: The game includes screens to start, restart, and end the game.
3. **Sound Effects**: Sound effects can be toggled ON and OFF during the game, with an icon that appears in the top-left corner to show the sound status. The following sounds have been created:
   - Game start
   - Game end
   - Jumping
   - Block collisions
   - Collecting coins
   - Defeating enemies
   - Discovering and capturing mushrooms
4. **Koopa Troopa Shell**: When Mario jumps on Koopa Troopa, it hides in its shell. Jumping on it again turns the shell into a projectile.
5. **Score Display**: Defeating an enemy shows the score points on the screen.
6. **Super Mario Invincibility**: If Super Mario is defeated and turns back into normal Mario, he flickers and becomes temporarily invincible, during which time he cannot be killed again.
7. **Game Interaction Keys**:
   - `R`: Restart the game.
   - `Q`: Force exit the game.
   - `M`: Toggle sound on/off. An icon appears in the top-left corner to indicate sound status.
   - `T`: Activate **Test Mode** (allows continuing the game even if Mario is killed). Once activated, **Test Mode** cannot be deactivated, and it is indicated by the text "TEST MODE" in red on the screen.
